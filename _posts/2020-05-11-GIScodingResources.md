# General R packages

* **Tools for Downloading, Customizing, and Processing Time Series of Satellite Images from Landsat, MODIS, and Sentinel** <https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/RGISTools>

* `geodata`: Package for downloading geographic data (climate, elevation, soil, species occurrence, administrative boundaries) <https://github.com/rspatial/geodata>

# R packages for specific products

* **NDVI / MODIS**: <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.1273> (possibly made obsolete by package `RGISTools`?)

* **Landsat processing** <https://www.jstatsoft.org/htaccess.php?volume=43&type=i&issue=04&paper=true>

* **Two alternative packages for accessing more recent landsat 8** <https://github.com/atlanhq/rLandsat> and <https://github.com/Terradue/rLandsat8> 

* **Sentinel data** in case useful (much higher resolution but shorter time span). <https://www.researchgate.net/post/Is_there_a_R_function_to_download_Sentinel_images> (possibly made obsolete by package `RGISTools`?)

# R packages for Data Analysis

* **Remote-Sensing Toolbox** <https://github.com/bleutner/RStoolbox> and <https://github.com/RRemelgado/rsMove>

* **Movement Data Visualization** <http://movevis.org> and <https://github.com/cran/moveVis/>


# A small selection of good tutorials

* <https://rspatial.org/rs/rs.pdf>

* As well as this (in French only, unfortunately, but worth the effort, maybe with some help from google translate): <https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/460964_b2d547f991474d2e8c94a2ef17d58b03.html#adaptation-des-resolutions-entre-deux-rasters-resample>


# Free ebooks

* **Google Earth Engine Applications** <https://www.mdpi.com/books/pdfview/book/1262>

* (free only during COVID crisis?) **selection of Springer books** <https://link.springer.com/search?package=mat-covid19_textbooks&showAll=true&facet-language=%22En%22>


# Not free ebooks

* **Remote Sensing Image Classification in R** <https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-13-8012-9>
