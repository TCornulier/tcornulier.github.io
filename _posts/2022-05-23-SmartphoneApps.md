## Random sampling

* **Random UX**: random number generator with min-max range, random draws from lists, coin toss

## Measurement and logging

### Physical environment

* **Phyphox**: view and log all sensor measurements from your phone in real time: temperature, light, sound, accelerometer, barometer... Also provides a wealth of additional sensor-based tools or learning.
* **Physics Toolbox Suite**: view and log all sensor measurements from your phone in real time: temperature, light, sound, accelerometer, barometer...

### Plant traits or habitat

* [**Plant Screen Mobile**](https://fz-juelich.de/ibg/ibg-2/EN/methods/Plant_Screen_Mobile_PSM/psm_node.html): Leaf area index and more. Open access paper: <https://plantmethods.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13007-019-0386-z>.
* [**LeafByte**](https://zoegp.science/leafbyte): for measuring herbivory and leaf area. Open access supporting paper: <https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.13340>.
* [**EasyLeafArea (Android)**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heaslon.EasyLeafArea&gl=US): for measuring leaf area with a scale reference on the picture.
* [**CanopyCapture**](https://nikp29.github.io/CanopyCapture/): for measuring canopy cover (replaces a densiometer).

### Sound recording

* **Amazing MP3 Recorder**: good for sound recording (not just in MP3, also does high quality Wav). Best with an external microphone.
* **RecForge II**: good for sound recording (also does high quality Wav). Best with an external microphone.

## Taxonomic ID

* **Echometer touch**: companion app to echo meter bat recording device (one available in the University of Aberdeen zoology teaching pool). Sonagram visualisation + automatic ID.
* **Seek**: automatic plant ID
* [**Plantnet**](https://plantnet.org/en/): automatic plant ID (as with everything else, treat automatic plant ID with great caution and scepticism!)
* [**Merlin**](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/): maps, visual ID guide and automatic bird sound ID by Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Covers all birds of the World.

## Monitoring
### Existing programs

* **eBird** app and [eBird website](https://ebird.org/home)
* **iNaturalist**

### Create own recording forms

* **Epicollect5** app: online / offline recording. Form to be created on web interface first ([website](https://five.epicollect.net/)). Fairly simple interface for simple to more advanced forms.
* [**Google forms**](https://www.google.co.uk/forms/about/): very simple interface for very basic forms. Online only.

## Navigation and mapping

* **Google maps**: offline capability (check options and settings in the app).
* **Navigation** (by Google)
* **Maverick**: online / offline, lots of map backgrounds available. Limited number of waypoints available to record in free version.
* **GPS status**

## Misc.

* [**Where to watch birds in Scotland** App](https://www.the-soc.org.uk/about-us/app#:~:text=Where%20to%20Watch%20Birds%20in%20Scotland%2C%20the%20Club's%20free%20mobile,by%20more%20than%2010%2C000%20users.): a good guide by the Scottish Ornithologists' Club ([SOC](https://www.the-soc.org.uk/)).
