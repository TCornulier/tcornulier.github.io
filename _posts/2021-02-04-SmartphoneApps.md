## Measurement and logging

* **Phyphox**: view and log all sensor measurements from your phone in real time: temperature, light, sound, accelerometer, barometer... Also provides a wealth of additional sensor-based tools or learning.
* **Physics Toolbox Suite**: view and log all sensor measurements from your phone in real time: temperature, light, sound, accelerometer, barometer...
* [**Plant Screen Mobile**](https://fz-juelich.de/ibg/ibg-2/EN/methods/Plant_Screen_Mobile_PSM/psm_node.html): Leaf area index and more. Open access paper: <https://plantmethods.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13007-019-0386-z>.
